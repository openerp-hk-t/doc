Our open-source Auto-SQL engine seamlessly translates natural language inquiries into accurate SQL queries, allowing businesses using Odoo to extract valuable insights directly from their local databases—no coding required. Once data is retrieved, a large language model processes the results and generates human-readable responses using customizable templates, making complex analytics accessible to non-technical users. This AI-driven approach empowers decision-makers to ask real business questions—like “What are our top-selling products this quarter?” or “Which clients have overdue invoices?”—and receive instant, actionable answers, dramatically enhancing data visibility, operational awareness, and strategic planning within the Odoo ecosystem.
