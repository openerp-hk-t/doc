🌟 Auto-SQL Sales Assistant
Empowering Smarter, Faster, and More Accurate Sales Decisions

Auto-SQL Sales Assistant is a next-generation sales enablement tool that seamlessly integrates reinforcement learning and large language models (LLMs) with your Odoo system. Designed for modern sales teams, it provides real-time access to critical business data through natural language interactions—eliminating the need for complex queries or navigating multiple system menus.

🔍 Key Features
Natural Language Querying
Sales staff can ask questions like "Do we have item X in stock?" or "What are this month’s best-selling products?"—and receive instant, accurate responses.

Real-Time Inventory Insight
Always stay updated. View current stock levels, availability by warehouse, and expected replenishments—all in real time.

Intelligent Customer Insights
Instantly access customer order history, payment status, and support interactions to personalize and improve every sales conversation.

Market Trend Forecasting
Using advanced AI models, Auto-SQL predicts product demand trends, helping your team stay one step ahead in dynamic markets.

Seamless Odoo Integration
Fully compatible with your on-premise or cloud-based Odoo system. No complex setup—just install the Auto-SQL add-on and connect your preferred LLM.

Cross-Platform Chat Compatibility
The assistant can be integrated with WhatsApp, Telegram, LINE, and other popular messaging platforms, making it easy to reach users on their terms.

🧠 Why Auto-SQL?
Reduce operational overhead with automated data querying and intelligent summaries.

Enhance decision-making with AI-generated insights and recommendations.

Boost customer satisfaction by offering immediate, accurate information across platforms.

Accelerate training—new staff can get up to speed quickly using conversational access to system data.











Our open-source Auto-SQL engine seamlessly translates natural language inquiries into accurate SQL queries, allowing businesses using Odoo to extract valuable insights directly from their local databases—no coding required. Once data is retrieved, a large language model processes the results and generates human-readable responses using customizable templates, making complex analytics accessible to non-technical users. This AI-driven approach empowers decision-makers to ask real business questions—like “What are our top-selling products this quarter?” or “Which clients have overdue invoices?”—and receive instant, actionable answers, dramatically enhancing data visibility, operational awareness, and strategic planning within the Odoo ecosystem.
